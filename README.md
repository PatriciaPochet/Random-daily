### Random-daily
Daily meeting animation with a program to call students one by one. 

During our Wild Code School training, we have a daily each morning with all the class. In December, our trainer asked each one of us to anime the daily. 
My turn was for the first daily of 2022, on Monday the 3rd of January. 
As we already had 2 very creative "random modules" (one a blackboard and one done with a christmas hat) to call students, I decided to create my own random module with Python. 
Here you will find it. :-)
